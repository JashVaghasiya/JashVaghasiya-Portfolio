LAPD Crime Data - Data Warehousing And Analytics Platform
Project Headline
Comprehensive end-to-end data analytics platform processing 15+ years of LAPD crime and arrest data using Azure cloud services, implementing medallion architecture and FBI NIBRS compliance standards to deliver actionable public safety insights through advanced data warehousing and visualization capabilities.
Technologies Used

Azure Services: Data Factory (ADF), Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Databricks, Key Vault, Logic Apps, DevOps
Data Processing: PySpark, SQL, Batch Processing, Apache Airflow
Analytics & Visualization: Power BI, KPI Dashboards, Geographic Clustering
Data Management: Data Validation Techniques, Monitoring Solutions, Star Schema Modeling
Architecture: Medallion Architecture (Bronze-Silver-Gold), Data Warehousing

Project Overview
This ongoing project focuses on building a comprehensive data pipeline and analytics platform for LAPD crime data spanning from 2010 to present. The solution addresses LAPD's transition to FBI NIBRS compliance by implementing a medallion architecture that transforms raw crime reports into standardized star schema data models. The platform handles complex data quality challenges inherent in paper-transcribed reports, geographic privacy constraints, and system migration complexities during LAPD's adoption of new Records Management Systems.
Architecture

Medallion Data Architecture: Implements Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned), and Gold (business-ready) data layers for systematic processing
API-to-Warehouse Pipeline: End-to-end data flow from API extraction to ADLS storage, Databricks transformation, and structured data warehousing
Star Schema Implementation: Structured data warehouse design optimized for analytics and reporting requirements
Cloud-Native Integration: Seamless Azure service integration with automated monitoring and validation frameworks

Technical Challenges

Data Quality Management: Addressing inconsistencies and errors from paper-transcribed crime reports requiring advanced validation techniques
Geographic Privacy Compliance: Implementing data anonymization for addresses rounded to nearest hundred block while maintaining analytical value
System Migration Complexity: Managing data pipeline stability during LAPD's transition to new Records Management Systems and FBI NIBRS standards
