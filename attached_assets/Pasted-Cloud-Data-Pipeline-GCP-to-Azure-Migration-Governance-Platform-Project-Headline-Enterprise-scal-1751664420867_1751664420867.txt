Cloud Data Pipeline: GCP to Azure Migration & Governance Platform
Project Headline
Enterprise-scale automated data pipeline solution enabling seamless migration, processing, and governance of large-scale datasets between Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure with zero data loss and comprehensive security controls.
Technologies Used

Azure Services: Data Factory (ADF), Databricks, Blob Storage, Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Key Vault, Logic Apps
Integration & Security: Self-hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR), Azure Active Directory (AAD), Unity Catalog
Source Platform: Google Cloud Storage (GCP)
Data Processing: PySpark, SQL, Watermark Column Implementation

Project Overview
This project involves building large-scale data pipelines to migrate, process, and govern data between Google Cloud and Azure. The solution implements a comprehensive three-layer architecture (landing, raw, intermediate, curated) with robust security, logging, and automated governance controls. The system handles both dimensional and fact tables with full-load and delta-load capabilities, ensuring data integrity and optimal performance through watermark column implementation for incremental loading.
